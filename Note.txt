C:\react\webpack-typescript>npm install typescript -D

\ means escape, without . means any character
$ means it has to be at the end

C:\react\webpack-typescript>npm run build
C:\react\webpack-typescript>npm install webpack-dev-server -D

C:\react\webpack-typescript>npm run serve
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/public/


C:\react\webpack-typescript>npm run build
C:\react\webpack-typescript>npm run start
Now if you click the error in the console, devtool will direct you to the index.ts file location where it causes the error.
